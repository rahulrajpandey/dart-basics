Basics of Dart programming language for beginners.

## what is Dart and why do we use it ?
Dart is a programming language developed by Google. It is used to build web, mobile, and desktop applications, and can also be used for server-side development. Dart is designed to be easy to learn and use, with a syntax similar to that of other popular languages such as Java and JavaScript. It also includes features such as garbage collection, type inference, and a built-in package manager. Dart is used in the development of the Flutter framework for building cross-platform mobile apps.
